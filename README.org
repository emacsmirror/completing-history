This package provides a command =completing-history-insert-item= to
insert an item from history using completion. It calls =completing-read=
to do this, meaning it will work with your preferred completion
framework. The package supports: the minibuffer, eshell, comint and
term.

There is also a function =completing-history-setup-keybinding= to setup
a keybinding for you in all supported contexts. By default it binds
=completing-history-insert-item= to =M-r= (usually bound to a command that
gets the previous history item matching a regexp) and unbinds the
companion =M-s= command (usually bound to a command that searches
forward in the history).

To customize the binding of =completing-history-insert-item=, use
=completing-history-binding=. To keep =M-s= from being unbound customize
=completing-history-unbind-M-s=.
